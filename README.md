# CNN-for-Image-Prediction
CNN built using Tensoflow and Keras using train and test data set
Hi all
this is a complete CNN to predict image classes that were passed to the train data set
a score is recived as output when we pass out test image
for the experiment purpose two cat and dog images were used to train, about 8000 images were passed to train
after trainig the model has been saved so you can directly run the run.py file to test the trained model
or u can use the following link to get the data set aand train it by your self
